## Preprocessing
We worked with the data in hdf5 format, with all training observations for a single chromosome in a single h5 file.
To build these files, run preprocessing/build_h5_from_bigwigs.py. This will take some time, to speed up parallelise across chromosomes [TODO: explain how].

## Training

Run training/chunked_train_single_chrom.py or training/train_single_chrom.py
We trained models initialized with different random seeds on each chromosome

## Predictions

Given a set of saved weights (i.e. as a result of training the same model on each chromosome as outlined above), predictions were generated by computing predictions from each set of weights and averaging them.

The full can be performed by running prediction/build_prediction_ensemble.py for each chromosome.
